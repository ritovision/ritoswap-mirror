# Managing Credentials

Your Local Blockchain uses a validator (private) key for block production that is randomly generated on each setup. This page covers credential management and security over that key.

## Security Model

We prioritize security by:
- **Not accepting imported private keys** - reduces risk of key exposure  
- **Generating fresh keys locally** - ensures uniqueness  
- **Limiting key operations** - only reveal, never import  

This design choice means we're not responsible for your private keys beyond initial generation.

## Revealing Validator Address

To see your validator's public information:

```bash
pnpm --filter local-blockchain run reveal:address
```

This shows:

- Ethereum address  
- Public key  

Safe to share these publicly.

## Revealing Private Key

⚠️ **EXTREME CAUTION REQUIRED** ⚠️  
To reveal the validator's private key:

```bash
pnpm --filter local-blockchain run reveal:key
```

This command:
- Shows security warnings  
- Requires explicit confirmation  
- Displays the private key temporarily  
- Auto-hides after 20 seconds  
- Clears terminal history  

### Security Features

- **Countdown Timer**: Key visible for limited time  
- **Terminal Clearing**: Automatic cleanup after display  
- **Interrupt Handling**: Ctrl+C clears screen immediately  
- **No Logging**: Key never written to files  

### When You Might Need This

- Importing validator to wallets  
- Debugging transaction signing  
- Manual transaction creation  
- Key backup (do this securely!)

## Key Storage

- Plaintext key (without `0x` prefix) → `config/keys/validator.key`
- `.env` stores `VALIDATOR_PRIVATE_KEY` / `VALIDATOR_ADDRESS`
- `VALIDATOR_ACCOUNT_BALANCE` controls the validator prefund in genesis

`pnpm --filter local-blockchain run clean` deletes all of the above. Run setup again to rotate the validator.

## Best Practices

- Never share private keys – Not in code, chat, or emails  
- Use test keys only – These are for development only  
- Rotate regularly – Run clean and setup for fresh keys  
- Secure backups – If you must backup, use encrypted storage
