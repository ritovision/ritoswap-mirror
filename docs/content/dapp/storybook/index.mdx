# Storybook Overview

Storybook is used as a **visual source of truth** for UI states, not as a testing framework. Stories document component states and provide reusable UI references for docs embeds. There is no component-test harness wired to Storybook today.

<Callout type="info">
Storybook is mocked by design. The goal is stable UI reference states, not live blockchain data.
</Callout>

## Structure

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="dapp" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name=".storybook" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="main.ts" />
      <FileTree.File name="preview.tsx" />
      <FileTree.File name="RitoTheme.ts" />
      <FileTree.File name="fonts.css" />
      <FileTree.File name="storybook-overrides.css" />
      <FileTree.Folder name="decorators" />
      <FileTree.Folder name="harnesses" />
      <FileTree.Folder name="mocks" />
      <FileTree.Folder name="stories" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.Folder name="app" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="components" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

Storybook loads stories from:

- `dapp/.storybook/stories/**/*.stories.@(ts|tsx|mdx)`
- `dapp/app/**/*.stories.@(ts|tsx|mdx)`
- `dapp/components/**/*.stories.@(ts|tsx|mdx)`

These globs are defined in `dapp/.storybook/main.ts`.

## Local commands

- `pnpm sb` runs the Storybook dev server at port 6006.
- `pnpm build-sb` builds a standalone Storybook to `dapp/storybook-static`.
- `pnpm build-sb:docs` builds Storybook directly into `docs/public/storybook-static` for inline doc embeds.

## Docs embedding

The docs site uses `docs/app/components/StorybookEmbed.tsx`, which renders an iframe pointing at `/storybook-static/iframe.html`. This works because `pnpm build-sb:docs` writes Storybook into `docs/public/storybook-static`.

## Deployment

Storybook is deployed separately from the docs site. The GitHub workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy-storybook.yml` builds `dapp/storybook-static` and deploys it via Vercel. The hosted Storybook is served at `ui.ritoswap.com` (Vercel project domain).
