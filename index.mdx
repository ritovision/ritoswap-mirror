# Welcome to RitoSwap Docs

Here's a [faucet](https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/faucet/ethereum/sepolia) for free testnet Ether to try out the Sepolia dApp with.


## The Who & Why

**Who created this?**

At least initially and currently, Rito, also known by his music alias 
[Rito Rhymes](https://ritorhymes.com), conceived and built this entire project end-to-end with the 
help of AI models, mostly Claude and ChatGPT.

/>

Rito is a *Chief Integration Officer* offering fractional services from 
[RitoVision](https://ritovision.com), his hybrid studio and consultancy. As you can also see from
the vision and execution of this project, he plays many roles and brings
them together harmoniously including full stack engineer, UX designer, 
product strategist, brand manager, music producer and artist.

Rito has had his work featured in *[The New York Times](https://ritovision.com/projects/fansite)* and blah blah blah

**Purpose of this showcase**

At least initially and currently, the purpose is to demonstrate one of Rito’s 
core value proposition as a Chief Integration Officer who synthesizes and
integrates domains across Product, Brand, UX & Technology to derisk and
amplify a project’s value.

This project entails many distinct layers working together and while no 
one layer is revolutionary in scope, how these layers work together, as if a 
small team were responsible for it, is itself a hallmark of multi-disciplinary 
expertise and cross-functional execution.

This project was built with AI co-piloting by hand, NOT by autonomous
agents. It would certainly be an impressive agentic workflow to put this
together, but no, Rito managed every edit by hand. It is not to say EVERY
line and every edit is audited fully (there’s always more time for that), but
that Rito takes full ownership of the process involved in the architecture
and actual construction of this full-stack eco-system.

**How does RitoSwap monetize?**


It doesn’t. It’s just intended as a showcase. It doesn’t collect and sell user
data or serve ads, nor does minting NFTs require a fee beyond gas fees,
and no fees are collected by RitoSwap for use of the Rango DEX widget.

**Where does the music come from?**

All included songs were produced by Rito with the help of some very 
talented audio engineers. He wrote the lyrics to all songs, performed his 
vocals and oversaw the production of the final output. There are some 
other excellent vocalists participating in the chorus of several of the 
songs (Hodeler and Altcoin Love). **None of the songs are AI generated.**

Here’s a sample

**Where did the style and branding come from in the RitoSwap dApp and this documentation site?**

RitoSwap and this Docs site are extensions of the [RitoVision](https://ritovision.com) branding. 
It is Bladerunner-inspired and borders on cyberpunk but remains creative 
professional with futuristic flare and holographic undertones.
